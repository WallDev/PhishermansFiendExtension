Phishing is one of major personal security risks in Internet this days.
Most websites, mostly the popular ones and which are in use by non-tech
savvies are a great findings for phishing techniques. This websites might be,
but not limited to, social networks, banks websites, email gateways and so
on.
In this document only websites phishing techniques will be reviewed, I
won't touch social phishing, email scamming and such at all.

<p>
As it can be seen from statistics breakdown above the targets for phishing
are mostly Service, Retail and Financial sectors in countries where
IT culture levels are not high.
The victims are mostly non-tech people who blindly click on everything that
appear on their screen allowing by this installation of malware and providing
willingly their credentials and personal info to non-legit third parties.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Why Phishing works</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Phishing attacks are more than just techniques. Studies show<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> that this attacks
are more social engeneering attacks and according to more studies <sup><a id="fnr.2.100" name="fnr.2.100" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> more
than 90% of people depend on website's design to verify it's authencity.
Well designed phishing websites that look completely like the originals or
implement most valuable parts of original design are more like to fool
person who comes there.
There is another problem found in how anti phishing applications work. If
the application is too intrusive, shows too many pop-ups it more likely to
be silenced and, eventually, disabled by the user<sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>.
Anti phishing applications that show unobtrusive warnings are more likely
to be ignored by the end user.
All of this makes phishing prevention very hard on human factor level.

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Phishing techniques <sup><a id="fnr.7" name="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Most common phishing types for web browsers are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Link (url?)Manipulation :: This technique uses disques to hide malicius website
behind an URL of well known websites. This might be misspelled URLs which
look very similar to the original but lack or have different just one
letter, URLs with wrong TLD, correct website name though in practice are
subdomains of different websites. With introduction of IDN another level of
danger were added where phishing domain can look exactly as original one by
substituting one letter with letter from different language alphabet.
Some examples are:
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <a href="http://f%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B5book.com">http://fасеbook.com</a> </dt><dd>This one seems completely legit but in fact half
of letters here are in Russian.
</dd>
<dt> <a href="http://goog1e.com">http://goog1e.com</a>  </dt><dd>This one is a bit easier to spot but it depends on
the font installed for the web browser.
</dd>
<dt> <a href="http://gooogle.com">http://gooogle.com</a> or <a href="http://faceboook.com">http://faceboook.com</a> </dt><dd>Simple mistypes,
nevertheless most people fail to notice the difference at first.
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Website Forgery :: Usually this one is coupled with link manipulation
technique but it's not a must. For this type of attack scammer designing a
website which looks completely same as target. When victim enters this
phishing website he can't say the difference including the URL which
changed by JavaScript to masquerade the website completely. Later on the
scammer might request from victim to login to what seems legit website and
provide an oAuth login pop-up for his google (Facebook or any other oAuth
provider) website. After victim accepts it - scammer gets the auth<sub>token</sub>
for this user and depending on privileges that he was able to approve for
his website. This technique might also be used to get login credentials for
websites which are not using oAuth log in authentication.
</li>
<li>Covert Redirect :: This technique uses links that look like legit on
original websites but instead are carefully forged redirect links that take
victim to an attacker's web site. The rest from here is just like in
website forgery, after victim clicks on the link he might receive, for
example, oAuth login pop-up for which if he agrees he providing access to
his personal information. The main problem with this type of attack is
that it is very hard to spot as attacker might use original website for
this attack. It is possible, under certain circumstances, to inject
required links to websites like Facebook which will look completely
legitimate. (tests on facebook)

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Available Solutions and their problems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Solutions might be separated in 3 categories, each one with it pros and
cons. Most anti phishing software rely on combination between this
approaches to provide best hit rate.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-1"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Whitelists</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
This solution provides a list of whitelisted URLs which are safe to access
and proven as non-phishing websites. As much as this solution is good it
also have some flaws:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is virtually impossible to include all of legitimate websites on
internet into a whitelists.
</li>
<li>User still have to verify manually that the website is legit as it is
possible, under some curcumstances, to fool whitelist checker and feed it
with good URL while taking victim to phishing website
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-2"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> Blacklists</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
This solution provides a lits of phishing sites and preventing end user to
open the targeted websites.
The problem with this solution mainly lies in fact that according to APWG
research most of the phishing websites are short living. An avarage life
time span for them is less than 40 hours for 2016<sup><a id="fnr.8" name="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>. Most of such websites,
and I'm talking about avarage of 4033 attacks per day<sup><a id="fnr.1.100" name="fnr.1.100" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.8.100" name="fnr.8.100" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>, are not reported to
corresponding blacklists of antiphishing software therefore are not blocked
for the end user.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-3"><span class="section-number-3">5.3</span> Heuristic aproaches</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
In this category are solution based on different researches which try to
identify phishing resource on-fly. This approaches might use different
types of data collected from the page to set a trust score and act
according to the score received. They might take in consideration URLs,
links on page, domain age, spelling errors, known images/files from high
risk websites, etc. For example SpoofGuard<sup><a id="fnr.9" name="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup> checks  the
current domain name, then the full URL is analyzed to de-tect obfuscation
as well as non-standard port numbers, then Spoofguard analyzes the contents,
making note of any password  felds, embedded links, and images.
The problem with such approaches is:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It can be fooled if alghorithm of the approach is known.
</li>
<li>It can hit false positive on legitimate websites
</li>
<li>It can miss phishing websites.
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Proposed solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
In the world of open software we have more power to secure the web and
build trust network.
The proposed solution consists of combination of all 3 approaches but
extended to limitless extend of community contribution.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-6-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-1"><span class="section-number-3">6.1</span> Phishing detection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
Detecting phishing websites are done by combination of Whitelists,
blacklists and heuristic approaches where the heuristic approach is
extendable by community.
The checkers are sitting on remote server and are voted by community. In a
long run I belive that the most valuable checkers will be promoted to be
first.
While this approach obviously have a drawback of lag for end user it could
be used in an async way where website is not loading until WL and BL are
checked and then the website is shown with disabled forms/buttons to
prevent user from clicking while the heuristic checkers are running.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-6-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-2"><span class="section-number-3">6.2</span> User notifications</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">
<p>
As it was discussed earlier, users don't like intrusive notifications and
tend to disable or ignore them if such happen.
To address this issue I propose the following:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Website is not loading until the Whitelist and Blacklist checks finish
</li>
<li>Website loads with all links, buttons and forms set to "disabled" to
prevent user from clicking on them until the heuristic checks are done.
</li>
<li>If website is clearly a phishing website the content is overlayed and
blocked with explanation and a link to report non-phishing website to
review if user thinks it's a mistake
</li>
<li>If website might be phishing but it's not clear it's design is modified
in a very clear way to make user pay attention to it. At the top of the
website should be a bar shown with explanation why the websites look is
modified and suggestions on what and how to check with link to report non
phishing website as well.
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sec-6-3"><span class="section-number-3">6.3</span> Detection updates</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-3">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Whitelists and blacklists are hashes of URLs stored on servers.
</li>
<li>Checks are stored on Github page and allow contribution of community.
