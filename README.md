# Introduction
**DEVELOPMENT VERSION!**
An anti-phishing extension for chrome which moves all the heavy load checks to the server where they can be run in paralel to reduce load on clients computer becuase we know that broswers are slow
It also does not (almost) interfere with user and works silently until something bad is happen, then it will kick in with different reaction to different severity of threat.

For documentation about how the extansion works please check out the [server readme file](https://github.com/WallDev/PhishermansFiendServer/blob/master/README.md)

## Extension guide
To install the extension simply download this file (TODO) and click on it. Chrome browser should install it for you.
To make the extension work you should first go to https://88.99.85.182:8080 accept the security exception and import the ceritificate. 
You can check how to import certificate on different versions of Chrome [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7580508/getting-chrome-to-accept-self-signed-localhost-certificate), as they do it differently.

After the certificate is successfully imported to chrom just continue to browse the web to see results.
